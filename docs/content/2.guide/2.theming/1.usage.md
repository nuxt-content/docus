# Using a theme

Docus is made to be used with themes and aims at making it both easy to use and customize.

## Setting up a theme

In general, you'll create your Docus project with the starter, that ships with `@docus/docs-theme`.

If you want to change your theme you can change the `extends` key of your `nuxt.config`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['./node_modules/@docus/docs-theme'],
})
```

## Overwriting

If you want to overwrite **any** component provided by a theme to make it yours, the method is really easy!

As you project files will always have priority over the theme ones, you only have to keep the naming.

Let's say you want to update the `fluid.vue` layout from `@docus/docs-theme`.

You simply have to create a `layouts/fluid.vue` file at your project-level.

This layout will take priority over the one provided by the theme, and let you override it.

Most themes are shipped as NPM packages that has the exact same structure as any other Nuxt project.

That means you can easily:
- Dig into `node_modules/@docus/docs-theme/layouts`
- Make a copy of `fluid.vue` in `layouts/`
- Apply your changes
- Keep your pages using `layout: fluid`, and profit of the new additions you've made!

This pattern is really convenient for both the theme author and the person in charge of the project using it!
