title: "What is Docus ?"
description: "Docus is a documentation generator based on Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Content."
---

It comes with all of these two technologies features:

::list

- Edge and Static rendering
- First-class developer experience
- Wide ecosystem of modules
- A Markdown syntax made for Vue components (**MDC**)
- Navigation generation
- Code highlighting
- Blazing fast hot module replacement in development

::

Docus combines these two and creates a seamless integration of your content files into your website pages.

## Some history

Docus is inherited from `@nuxt/content-theme-docs`, which used to be the documentation theme for `@nuxt/content`.

The `@docus/docs-theme` package is now the official alternative to `@nuxt/content-theme-docs` using Nuxt 3.

You can see Docus as a extendable Nuxt 3 project that comes with batteries included to build documentation websites.
