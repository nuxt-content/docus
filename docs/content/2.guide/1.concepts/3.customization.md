# Customization

Docus comes with utilities that takes advantage of Nuxt 3 extending features to provide an amazing developer experience for theme authors.

`@docus/base` enforce a specific way to build a website with Nuxt which allows theme authors to focus on providing components and layouts.

It also allows the Docus team to continually improve the Docus ecosystem without needing theme authors to update anything.

## Theming

Themes are regular Nuxt 3 projects that extends `@docus/base` and has a `theme` key in `nuxt.config`.

These themes can extend your project by adding `modules`, `pages`, `components`, `plugins` and anything else that a native Nuxt 3 project supports.

In the [Theming](/guide/theming/usage) section, you'll discover how to use themes with Docus.
