# Layout

> Customize your website with slots or overwrite the layout components. ðŸ§©

With the power of the [Nuxt Components](https://github.com/nuxt/components#overwriting-components), every part of the template is fully customizable.

Overwriting a component is simple as creating a new component.

If you want to overwrite `AppLayout`, simply create a `AppLayout.vue` in your `components` directory.

You can then easily re-implement a custom layout, or any other component from our default theme.

## Parts

Docus template is designed to be simple and flexible.

The template consists of **five** main components that create the structure of the template:

- `<AppLayout>`
- `<AppHeader>`
- `<AppFooter>`
- `<AppAside>`
- `<AppPage>`

Please take a look at the [components](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/docus/tree/main/src/components/organisms/app) directory to jump right into the code.

### `<AppLayout>` [ :icon-git-hub{class="inline -mt-2 w-6"} ](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/docus/tree/main/src/components/organisms/app/AppLayout.vue)

This component declares the main structure of the page. `<AppHeader>`, `<AppAside>` and `<AppPage>` are wrapped together inside this component.

### `<AppHeader>` [ :icon-git-hub{class="inline -mt-2 w-6"} ](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/docus/tree/main/src/components/organisms/app/AppHeader.vue)
