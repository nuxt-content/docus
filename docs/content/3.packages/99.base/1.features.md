# Features

The `@docus/base` package ships with all the default features provided by Docus.

It is **not** supposed to be used directly by your project, but by themes authors.

Still, if you want a clean start without any UI-related features but all the Docus features, you can use it.

::list
- `theme` key and `_theme.yml` support
- Pre-configured modules
- Loading bar
- useDocus

- Debug utils
