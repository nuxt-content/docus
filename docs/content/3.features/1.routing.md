# Filesystem routing

A good looking website from any directory. ðŸ”®

---

Each Markdown file in the `content/` directory will become a page and will be listed in navigation.

You can also put your Markdown files in nested directories to generate nested routes.

::code-group

``` [Directory structure]
content/
â”œâ”€ examples/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ basic-usage.md
â”œâ”€ setup.md
```

``` [Generated routes]
/examples/basic-usage
/setup
```

## Ordering

You can easily build the navigation order from any directory using number prefixes.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
â”œâ”€ 1.deployments/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 1.vercel.md
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 1.netlify.md
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 1.heroku.md
â”œâ”€ 2.frameworks/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 1.vue.md
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 1.nuxt.md
```

## Ignoring

If you are working on a draft that you do not want to be list in the navigation or accessible via as a separate page, just prefix it with `"."`.

It will ignore this file and it will not be accessible unless you're in **development** or **admin** mode.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
â”œâ”€ 1.foo/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ .foo.md // Ignored file
â”œâ”€ .2.bar/ // Ignored directory
â”‚  â”œâ”€ bar.md
```

## Non-Page Contents

If you have some files that you don't want to have them as a separated pages but you want search among them, just prefix it with `"_"`.

The only way to access these files is to use `queryContent` API.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
â”œâ”€ 1.foo/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ _foo.md // Filtered file
â”œâ”€ _2.bar/ // Filtered directory
â”‚  â”œâ”€ bar.md
```

::alert
**Note**: The beginning `_` will remove from document path, and you don't need to use `_` in search queries.
