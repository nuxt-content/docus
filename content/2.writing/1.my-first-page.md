# Writing my first page

The fastest path to writing your content. üèé

---

Let's walk through the creation of a simple introduction page.

## Create the file

With Docus, a page is a Markdown file inside content directory.

```zsh [Directory structure]
content/
  1.index.md
```

## Write Front-matter

Specifying [Front-matter](/writing/front-matter) data lets you configure your page data.

```markdown [index.md]
---
navigation: false // We want to hide this page from navigation
layout: page
---
```

## Use your components

Using our custom syntax, you can easily add and configure components into your pages.

```markdown [index.md]
::block-hero
---
cta:
  - Get started
  - /writing/my-first-page
secondary:
  - Open on GitHub ‚Üí
  - https://github.com/nuxtlabs/docus
snippet: npx nuxi init --template=docus
